## Upcoming Tasks
1. ~~Initialize Go module with dependencies~~ ✓
2. ~~Create project structure~~ ✓
3. ~~Implement models package~~ ✓
4. ~~Set up testing framework~~ ✓
5. ~~Implement basic fileio module (reader.go, discovery.go)~~ ✓
6. ~~Implement core calculations module (cost.go, stats.go)~~ ✓
7. Complete fileio module (watcher.go)
8. Implement sessions module (manager.go, detector.go)
9. Create sample test data

## Blockers
- None

## Notes
- Considering ByteDance Sonic for JSON parsing performance
- Will implement streaming JSONL processing for memory efficiency
- Focus on modular design for easy testing and maintenance
